##About Assignment
Overview: 
You are provided with an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files: 
Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. Your task is to perform 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights. This 
assignment will test your data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation skills. 
Customers.csv:

Files Description: 
1. Customers.csv 
○ CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer. 
○ CustomerName: Name of the customer. 
○ Region: Continent where the customer resides. 
○ SignupDate: Date when the customer signed up. 
2. Products.csv 
○ ProductID: Unique identifier for each product. 
○ ProductName: Name of the product. 
○ Category: Product category. 
○ Price: Product price in USD. 
3. Transactions.csv 
○ TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction. 
○ CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction. 
○ ProductID: ID of the product sold. 
○ TransactionDate: Date of the transaction. 
○ Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased. 
○ TotalValue: Total value of the transaction. 
○ Price: Price of the product sold.

Assignment Tasks: 
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights 
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset. 
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA. 


Task 2: Lookalike Model 
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar 
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should: 
● Use both customer and product information. 
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer. 

 
Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering 
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information 
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv). 
● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in 
between(2 and 10)  
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this). 
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots. 

Submission Instructions: 

1. GitHub Link  
○ Upload all the PDF and code files in a public GitHub repository.
  
3. File Naming Convention: 
○ Use the following naming convention for all your files: 
■ FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf 
■ FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb 
■ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv 
■ FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb 
■ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf 
■ FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb



Evaluation Process: 
Your submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 
Task

Given the large number of submissions, the evaluation will be automated as much as possible. 
Ensure your file formats and naming conventions are accurate to avoid disqualification. 
Final Note: 
This comprehensive assignment requires critical thinking and practical application of data 
science concepts. Focus on creating clean, efficient code and providing meaningful insights that 
can help the company improve its business strategy. 
Good luck!
